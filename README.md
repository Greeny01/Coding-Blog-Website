Welcome to the Coding Blog Website repository! This project is a perfect starting point for beginners in web development, providing a foundational structure for a blog platform.

This repository contains a basic yet functional coding blog website with essential pages and features to help you get started with your web development journey. While the site is not fully populated with guides and content, it includes the core components needed for a blog:

1) Home Page: The main landing page where your blog posts will eventually be displayed.
2) About Page: A dedicated section to introduce the blog and its purpose.
3) Contact Page: A form for visitors to reach out to the blog's author or administrator.
4) Login and SignUp Pages: Authentication pages to manage user access.
